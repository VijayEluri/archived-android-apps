A couple of Android apps.

Cineworld - The first and original Cineworld app for Android.  Totally unofficial and fairly popular, but Cineworld wouldn't fund it and began building their own anyway.  Interestingly, the iOS version of the Cineworld app came out way before the Android version. 

d20Toos - The code for the free app that can be found on the Android Market.
